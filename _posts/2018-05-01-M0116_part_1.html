<p>I have a few old apple keyboards</p>


<h2>Reverese engineering the matrix</h2>
<p>This was not so hard, though it was quite tedious, Just a matter of finding which pins on the controller each side of each switch is connected to.</p>

<p>The matrix on the M0116 has 10 rows and 8 columns for 74 of the 81 switches, with the modifiers (and power key) connected to separate pins and the ground plane,
    the two shift keys are connected in parallel</p>


<h2>Wiring it up with a teensy</h2>

<p>The easiest way to wire this up without modifying the board is to copy the wiring and connect the 8x10 matrix</p>
